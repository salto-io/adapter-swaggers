# adapter-swaggers

This repository holds stable versions of REST API Swagger definitions for [Zuora Billing](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/) and Atlassian Jira [Cloud Platform](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/) and [Software Cloud](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/rest).

## Using this repository
The "Fetch Swaggers" action is scheduled to run nightly, but can also be run manually via the "Actions" menu.

When there is an updated swagger, it will automatically create a PR that should be reviewed and merged manually once it is considered "stable"
