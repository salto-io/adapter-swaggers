# adapter-swaggers

This repository holds a stable version of [Zuora Billing](https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/swagger.yaml) API swagger definitions. 

## Using this repository
The "Fetch Swaggers" action is scheduled to run nightly, but can also be run manually via the "Actions" menu.

When there is an updated swagger, it will automatically create a PR that should be reviewed and merged manually once it is considered "stable"
